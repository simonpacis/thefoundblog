title: Our vision

In the summer of 2017 an idea popped into our heads. We had attended a seminar on social media, and got to talking about the current state of Christian social media. In the end we had summarized our thoughts into a single sentence: "Relation before information". We had a burning desire to create a cross-cultural blog, but didn't know what or how.  
A lot of times when posting about faith we tend to focus purely on the information we want to get across. We wanted to change that. We believe that the most important aspect of communicating faith is vulnerability and experiences.  
  
THE FOUND BLOG tries to portray battles and victories from all around the world through a combination of poetry and photography. To throw down the mask and speak up about all of life. To remember the human condition and the majestic redemption. So that we might remember, in the face of opposition, that our God is.
