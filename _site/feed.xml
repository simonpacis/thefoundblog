The dead deserters, the nomads of dust&lt;br /&gt;
The flitting murderers of all things good&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are the hopeless, the lonesome&lt;br /&gt;
The battlers of depression, the tired watchers&lt;br /&gt;
Standing vigil over barren land&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fight the tears of sadness&lt;br /&gt;
Suppress the longing within&lt;br /&gt;
Let me be liked, let me be seen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our bodies shriek to the heavens&lt;br /&gt;
Crippling from exhaustion&lt;br /&gt;
Why does no one love me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We long for the sweet taste of rain&lt;br /&gt;
To smell the scent of dissipating pain&lt;br /&gt;
We yearn to be free from it all, at last&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have been found by Him&lt;br /&gt;
The rose of our kin, sprung up from&lt;br /&gt;
the very deathful lands we walk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pained yet persevering&lt;br /&gt;
The hated yet everloving&lt;br /&gt;
The dead yet resurrected&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He, this our prince of peace&lt;br /&gt;
Loving, for it is who he is&lt;br /&gt;
Found us here in the valley of doom&lt;br /&gt;
And brought us home, from our death’s womb&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Simon Pacis</name></author><summary type="html">We are the cracked skulls, dry to the core The dead deserters, the nomads of dust The flitting murderers of all things good We are the hopeless, the lonesome The battlers of depression, the tired watchers Standing vigil over barren land We fight the tears of sadness Suppress the longing within Let me be liked, let me be seen Our bodies shriek to the heavens Crippling from exhaustion Why does no one love me?
