In over my head in shallow waters  
Buoyant promises keeps my head afloat  
Yet to be disproved, they’re empowering  
Yet to weigh me down, they’re flowering  
I’ll live my very best life now  
I’ll sow my first fruits  
How He’ll open the floodgates before me  
  
Idolatry is a fickle commodity  
Serving my being, giving my all  
Extending a helping hand upon the I  
Disguised as blessing and treasure  
I despise all not giving pleasure  
Seeking gold in these foreign lands  
Abandoning the love in my homeland  
  
Drowning in my self and my greed  
My only companion, me  
My stone cold heart has taken hold  
Like ice at the core of my soul  
Betraying my feet, this selfish wandering  
All that I seek  
Is prosperity for the meek
