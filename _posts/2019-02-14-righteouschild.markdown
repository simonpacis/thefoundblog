I am the stubborn child  
The child of pain and anguish  
In the midst of your grace I burn it all down, all with a smile on my face  
  
I force you to fit  
To fit my expectations of you  
And if you don’t, woe to you!  
How dare you, creator, not to listen to me, the highliest of all, created?  
  
I but follow the noble traditions   
Of our bravest the Israelites  
Time and again you show me your might, but I turn far away in scorn and with slight  
  
You’re just the upholder of the universe, the mighty outstretched hand bringing doom to death and life to dead, the provider of my soul, the giver of all things  
  
But why can’t I feel you?  
All I require is a sign here on earth  
A simple whisper, an obvious healing  
Show, that I might believe  
Do, that I might trust you!  
  
How can you leave me so forlorn?  
Fumbling in darkness, with no hope for my future?  
Are you not good?  
Do you not love?  
Why have you abandoned me, oh omnipresent Father?
