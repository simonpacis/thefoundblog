I am laced with sin  
Is there no way to win?  
Watch the fear billow in  
Watch my knees fail again  
  
Conscience corrupted by lack of confessions  
I refuse to admit that I am thoroughly disconnected  
I refuse to agree that I am death and spreading it far  
In the darkest pit of my heart I see that I am the morning star  
  
I love the dark and dripping tar  
  
I confess with folded hands hoping to be given at once a second chance but I don’t seem to understand that I do not seem to understand  
  
That I am further from love than I thought, that my thought can’t break this rot, that false pretense and greatest words cannot seem to restore my lack of worth  
  
For like a fraud I stand in the cold  
Wishing someone would hold  
Wishing I would place my hope  
Not in myself and not in gold

Continuing the theme from “Burden”, I wrote “The Sinwin Conundrum” to reflect on some of the frustrations that inevitably arise when we try to make ourselves better through our own might.
