Step on their necks  
And strangle their lives  
Breathe the lies and pretend it’s all fine  
The world is burning and severely hurting  
The black man has been slaughtered for too long  
And I can’t understand  
But I’ll try as I can  
I simply can’t understand  
How they are treated as less than man  
How we let this murderous hurricane  
Devastate and reinstate what has been set straight  
I can’t believe it’s too late  
For they can’t breathe  
And here lies the problem  
That the call for justice is only synonymous with the autonomous and not the general populace and their governing opulence  
That justice is redefinable, never final  
That murder isn’t murder if it’s within our well-defined constraints  
And that some people are above the law  
And I simply can’t believe  
I choose not to believe  
That this is how it’s meant to be  
When will we allow them to break free?  
And be what we all want to be  
Human. And free.
