Your sin is a burden  
It’s what weighs you down, it’s what has to drown  
It’s the poison of your life, watch it take your crown  
It’s what you must control! Force it, lest it takes hold  
  
Your Lord, the Man of Freedom, look at him. It’s soon  
You must, no, you shall, stay accountable  
Go forth and sin no more  
My child, it’s time  
  
Your sin is yours  
Don’t lose your feet to the lies and deception  
Your sin is yours to kill  
My friend, it’s time  
You can do better  
  
You’ve been called to a better life than this. Pull yourself together.  
You’re a disgrace! How dare you call yourself one of us?  
You bring shame upon us all!  
Repent, see the hellfire approaching  
  
Are you drowning now?  
Has your sin consumed you?  
Has your body withered yet?  
Don’t fret, this is all you can expect  
After all, you’re living death  
  
Pray that your efforts are seen  
Pray that the Holiness forgives you  
He requires perfection  
How arrogant of you to pretend anything less  
Watch it devour the flesh you seek to outguess  
  
Are you accountable yet?  
Are you satisfied yet?  
Are you free from bonds yet?    
Do you feel burdened yet?
