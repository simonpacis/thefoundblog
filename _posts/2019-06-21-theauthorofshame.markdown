The author of shame  
Is all that I’ll ever be  
I wish that I could tame  
This deep desolation within  
That I might control my desires  
And banish these thoughts so dear  
  
But I’ve become my desolation  
Me and my people  
We’ve absorbed this isolation  
Clinging to a pseudo-synergism  
In denial, we work to birth cynicism  
  
Tolling to kill their reality  
It’s like we’ve grown an abnormality  
Survival-of-the-fittest  
We slave to make them unfit  
Work hard to make them quit  
  
All eyes on me  
Center stage is where I’ll be  
Keep these unworthy from me  
That I might be made worthy  
Climbing their skulls to suppress  
Their dissolution, my success  
  
Under a veil of humanity  
We kill for our vanity  
Slaughter for our sanity  
Is this Christianity?
