BLOWN  
are we. Dispersed far and wide  
RIPPED  
clean through our wretched hearts  
EXHAUSTED  
is the generation searching for hope in the darkness  
APATHETIC  
are we in our stumbling search for life  
KILLED  
is our horrendous existence, our deplorability  
  
we're screaming for meaning, the emptiness leads us to sob  
where  
is  
my  
life  
  
The gloomy bearers of the standards are triumphing the neglect of life  
**NOT MY LORD**  
That's alright but keep your faith to yourself  
That's alright but keep the eternal source to yourself  
That's alright but keep the only one who can save me to yourself  
THAT'S ALRIGHT but damn it keep the CREATOR OF THE WORLD away from me!  
  
We're the breathless generation unable to get enough of ourselves and yet despite this we still hate ourselves and all that we and ourselves carry of symbols and connotations  
  
I can  
We can  
Look at what humanity can  
  
Look at the emptiness our land became
