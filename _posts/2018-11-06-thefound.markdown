We are the cracked skulls, dry to the core  
The dead deserters, the nomads of dust  
The flitting murderers of all things good  
  
We are the hopeless, the lonesome  
The battlers of depression, the tired watchers  
Standing vigil over barren land  
  
We fight the tears of sadness  
Suppress the longing within  
Let me be liked, let me be seen  
  
Our bodies shriek to the heavens  
Crippling from exhaustion  
Why does no one love me?  
  
We long for the sweet taste of rain  
To smell the scent of dissipating pain  
We yearn to be free from it all, at last  
  
Here we have been found by Him  
The rose of our kin, sprung up from  
the very deathful lands we walk  
  
The pained yet persevering  
The hated yet everloving  
The dead yet resurrected  
  
He, this our prince of peace  
Loving, for it is who he is  
Found us here in the valley of doom  
And brought us home, from our deathâ€™s womb
